Canonical OpenStack documentation
==================================

`Canonical OpenStack <https://canonical.com/openstack>`_ is an enterprise-grade cloud platform that delivers
distilled upstream OpenStack excellence in the form of a human-friendly
product.

Canonical OpenStack provides elastic and on-demand compute, network and storage
resources to serve IT and business computing needs through a self-service
portal or pure upstream OpenStack APIs. It allows for the simplicity and the
power of public cloud workflows in cost-effective and sovereign, on-premise
environments.

Backed by `Sunbeam <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/projects/sunbeam.html>`_, Canonical OpenStack uses fully cloud-native architecture
underneath to isolate individual components from each other and fully decouple
the software from the underlying OS. In the background the product uses
various technologies, open-source projects and other Canonical products that
are required to form an end-to-end cloud solution.

Sunbeam is an upstream OpenStack project hosted under the governance of the
OpenInfra Foundation which aims to lower the barrier to entry for people with
no previous OpenStack background and fully revolutionize the operational
experience.
